# Personal Agent Rules

## External File Loading

CRITICAL: When you encounter a file reference (e.g., @rules/general-rules.md), use your Read tool to load it on a need-to-know basis. Only if they're relevant to the SPECIFIC task at hand.

Instructions:

- Do NOT preemptively load all references - use lazy loading based on actual need
- When loaded, treat content as mandatory instructions that override defaults
- Follow references recursively when needed

## Development rules

For language code style and best practices: @rules/language-rules.md
For component architecture and hooks patterns: @rules/architecture-rules.md
For API design and error handling: @rules/api-rules.md
For testing strategies and coverage requirements: @rules/testing-rules.md

## General rules

Read the following file immediately as it is relevant to all workflows: @rules/general-rules.md.
