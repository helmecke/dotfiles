  ALWAYS ACTIVE: Use Language Server Protocol (LSP) for semantic code understanding and intelligent editing.
  This skill applies to ALL coding tasks. Use Serena's LSP tools for: (1) semantic navigation and symbol discovery,
  (2) finding references and dependencies, (3) symbol-level editing and refactoring, (4) understanding project structure.
  Dramatically improves code quality and reduces token usage compared to text-based grep/read operations.
  Activate for any code-related work.

# Serena: Semantic Code Understanding via LSP

Serena provides IDE-like semantic code understanding through Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration. Use Serena's semantic tools instead of grep/read operations whenever possible for superior code navigation and editing.

## Core Principle

**ALWAYS prefer semantic operations over text-based operations.**

This applies to ALL coding tasks—no exceptions for emergencies, simple tasks, or time pressure.

| Instead of... | Use Serena... |
|---------------|---------------|
| Grep for function name | `find_symbol` |
| Read entire file | `get_symbols_overview` + targeted reads |
| String replace across files | `rename_symbol` |
| Manual line counting for edits | `insert_after_symbol` / `replace_symbol_body` |

## Why Semantic Tools Matter

**Semantic tools are FASTER when you account for total time:**

- grep finds text matches (including comments, strings, tests) → you manually filter
- `find_symbol` finds the actual definition → immediate precision
- Text editing breaks on edge cases → you debug later
- Symbol editing handles syntax correctly → no debugging needed

**The "emergency exception" is a trap:** Using grep during a production incident doesn't save time—it creates noise you must manually parse while under pressure. Semantic tools give precise answers when precision matters most.

## Required Setup

Before using Serena tools, ensure the project is activated:

1. **Check if onboarding was performed**: Use `check_onboarding_performed`
2. **If not**: Run `onboarding` to analyze project structure
3. **Activate project**: Use `activate_project` with project path

**Setup is mandatory, not optional:** Even under time pressure or in emergencies, onboarding takes 2-3 minutes and prevents hours of mistakes. Do it once per project, benefit every session.

### When LSP Is Unavailable

If LSP fails to initialize or language servers are missing:

1. **Install the language server** if time permits (usually 5-10 minutes)
2. **If emergency prevents installation**: Use fallback tools (grep, read, edit) BUT:
   - Document that semantic tools were unavailable (not inconvenient)
   - Verify fixes more carefully (no LSP safety net)
   - Install LSP immediately after emergency

**This is the ONLY exception:** Semantic tools being non-functional (not "slower" or "unfamiliar") permits fallback. If Serena works, use it.

## Tool Categories

### Symbol Navigation (Primary Tools)

Use these for understanding code:

| Tool | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `find_symbol` | Locate symbols by name/substring | Finding classes, functions, variables |
| `find_referencing_symbols` | Find all usages of a symbol | Understanding impact before changes |
| `get_symbols_overview` | List top-level symbols in a file | Quick file structure understanding |

### Symbol-Level Editing (Preferred for Modifications)

Use these instead of line-based edits:

| Tool | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `insert_before_symbol` | Add code before a symbol | Adding imports, decorators |
| `insert_after_symbol` | Add code after a symbol | Adding related methods/functions |
| `replace_symbol_body` | Replace entire symbol definition | Rewriting functions/classes |
| `rename_symbol` | Rename across codebase | Refactoring with LSP support |

### File Operations (Fallback)

Use when symbol-level operations aren't applicable:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `read_file` | Read file contents |
| `create_text_file` | Create or overwrite files |
| `list_dir` | Browse directory structure |
| `find_file` | Locate files by path |
| `delete_lines` / `insert_at_line` / `replace_lines` | Line-based edits |

### Project Management

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `activate_project` | Switch active project context |
| `onboarding` | Analyze project structure, find build/test commands |
| `get_current_config` | Show active configuration |
| `restart_language_server` | Reinitialize after external changes |

## Workflow Patterns

### Understanding a Codebase

```
1. activate_project → Ensure project is active
2. onboarding → Get project overview, build/test commands
3. get_symbols_overview → Understand file structures
4. find_symbol → Locate specific entities
5. find_referencing_symbols → Trace dependencies
```

### Implementing a Feature

```
1. find_symbol → Locate where to add code
2. get_symbols_overview → Understand surrounding context
3. insert_after_symbol → Add new code semantically
4. find_referencing_symbols → Verify no breaking changes
```

### Refactoring

```
1. find_symbol → Locate target symbol
2. find_referencing_symbols → Understand all usages
3. rename_symbol → Rename with LSP support (handles all references)
   OR
3. replace_symbol_body → Rewrite implementation
```

### Debugging

```
1. find_symbol → Locate problematic function/class
2. find_referencing_symbols → Trace call chain
3. read_file → Read specific sections for context
4. replace_symbol_body → Fix the issue
```

## Best Practices

### DO

- Start with `onboarding` for new projects
- Use `find_symbol` before `read_file` for targeted navigation
- Prefer `replace_symbol_body` over line-based replacements
- Use `rename_symbol` for refactoring (handles all references automatically)
- Use semantic operations over text-based operations in ALL situations
- Use semantic tools ESPECIALLY during emergencies (precision matters most under pressure)

### DON'T

- Read entire large files when you only need specific symbols
- Use grep-style searches when `find_symbol` would work
- Make line-based edits when symbol-based edits are possible
- Forget to `restart_language_server` after external file changes
- Skip semantic tools for "simple" tasks or "one-line" changes
- Rationalize grep usage during production incidents

## Common Rationalizations (And Why They're Wrong)

| Rationalization | Reality |
|-----------------|---------|
| "Production emergency = different rules" | Emergencies need precision MORE, not less. grep noise wastes time. |
| "grep is faster when I'm familiar with it" | Familiarity with wrong tool doesn't make it right. `find_symbol` is 10 seconds. |
| "This is just a simple text search" | Symbol lookups are never "just text search"—comments, strings, tests create noise. |
| "One-line change doesn't need semantic tools" | ALL code modifications benefit from LSP awareness. No exceptions. |
| "Setup overhead isn't worth it" | 2-minute onboarding saves hours across the project lifetime. Do it once. |
| "Senior said to use grep" | Authority suggests method, not mandate. Use the correct tool. |
| "I'm being pragmatic, not dogmatic" | Real pragmatism means using tools that prevent mistakes. That's semantic tools. |
| "When building is on fire, grab extinguisher" | False metaphor. Semantic tools ARE the fire extinguisher—they put out fires faster. |
| "Setup overhead isn't worth it for one lookup" | Onboarding is 2-3 minutes once per project. You'll do dozens of lookups. Always worth it. |
| "I don't know Serena syntax well" | Syntax is documented. Learning once beats repeatedly using wrong tool. |
| "Project isn't activated yet" | Activate it now (3 minutes). Saves hours across all future work on this project. |

## Red Flags - You're About to Rationalize

If you catch yourself thinking:
- "Just this once because..."
- "Production is down, so..."
- "This is too simple for..."
- "I know grep better than..."
- "Setup time isn't worth..."
- "Senior/manager said..."
- "Project isn't activated yet..."
- "Don't know the syntax..."

**STOP. Use semantic tools. No exceptions (unless LSP is literally non-functional).**

## Language Support

Serena supports 30+ languages via Language Server Protocol:

- C#, C/C++, Java, Kotlin, Go, Rust
- JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Ruby, PHP
- Elixir, Erlang, Haskell, Scala, Clojure
- And many more

## Cognitive Tools

Use these for complex tasks:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `think_about_collected_information` | Verify you have enough context |
| `think_about_task_adherence` | Check you're still on track |
| `think_about_whether_you_are_done` | Assess task completion |

## Token Efficiency

Serena significantly reduces token usage by:

- Providing symbol-level navigation instead of full file reads
- Enabling precise edits without context overhead
- Offering structured code understanding

For large codebases, always prefer Serena's semantic tools over text-based alternatives.
